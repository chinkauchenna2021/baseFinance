### baseFinance

    This repository contains the code for the baseFinance project. 
    The baseFinance project is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on the MoonBeam blockchain.
    

## Introduction

    baseFinance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to provide users with a transparent and secure platform for managing their loans and investments. It leverages smart contracts on the MoonBeam blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer lending and borrowing operations.
      
    The users is expected to send USDC or AVEE to the contract where he get Eth in return as loan. And his/her token as collateral.

    He is expected to return the borrowed ETH then and only then will the contract return his USDC or AVEE  token.

    This repository contains the smart contracts and associated code that power the baseFinance protocol. The contracts are written in Solidity, and the project utilizes various MoonBeam development tools and frameworks.


## Installation

    To install and set up the baseFinance project locally, follow these steps:
    
    1. Clone the repository: 
        git clone https://github.com/chinkauchenna2021/baseFinance.git
    2. Install the necessary dependencies:
        cd baseFinance
        yarn install
    3. Running the project:
        yarn serve
    

## Usage

    To use the baseFinance protocol, you can interact with the deployed smart contracts through a web interface or directly via smart contract function calls.

    The protocol provides functionality for both lenders and borrowers. Lenders can deposit their funds into the lending pool and earn interest over time. 
    
    Borrowers can request loans by providing collateral and pay interest on the borrowed funds.
